# Quick Guide to Fatewright
## Format of the pages (.fwpg files)
### Overview
Pages, or pagefiles, are the smallest coherent units through which the story is presented to the player. Each choice the player makes in the story, leads the program to another page. These pages have story content, instructions for Fatewright, and finally, information about the options to be presented to the player. Page files have the extension ".fwpg", which stands for Fatewright page.
### Scripts
Each page has two sections, separated by `/--`, which signifies the end of story content of this page and the beginning of option information. Within the story content may be runtime instructions for Fatewright. Each instruction is triggered by a keyword, here referred to as a command. These commands are of three types: inline, invoked, and nestable. \
Inline commands are single-word commands generally used for formatting (newlines, paragraphs etc), and can be used in the same line with the story text, hence the name. \
Invoked commands are less simple, and are preceeded by a `/` and a whitespace. The `/` declares that the next word is an invoked command. These commands expect arguments, and often (though not in all cases) parse the remainder of the line they appear in, to find them. This is why it is good practice to write the invoked commands in their own line. \
Nestable commands are similar to invoked commands in that they expect arguments, but they are more complex (and more powerful) than invoked commands. Each nestable command opens its own reader (think sub-page), where other commands can appear just like they appear anywhere else in the page. Several levels of nested commands can be written in this manner. However, since this uses recursion to achieve the nesting, it is advisable to use it sparingly. See [examples]() for usage instances. Nested commands are invoked with a `/nest` followed by a whitespace, and are ended with a `/endnest` followed by the nest level which is to be closed. The top level is `0`, and it increases the deeper the nesting grows. \
Apart from these commands, line comments are also supported. Everything in a line after `/$` is ignored by Fatewright.
