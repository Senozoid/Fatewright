# Chronon
Chronon is an opensoure project (written in Java) to facilitate the creation of custom text-based games, such as CYOA books, gamebooks or other kinds of interactive fiction books.

### Quick backstory (for my first GitHub repository)
When I was in college, I started making a text adventure game called Zenerian Chronicles. There were tools to help with this, but since at that time I was not aware of any such tools which gave me complete control over the game mechanics, I decided to build the game from scratch using my very limited Java knowledge. As I was writing the code for what would basically be the engine for my game, I realised that to give myself some freedom in the future, I was making the engine entirely independent of the story I write. This meant that others could use my engine to turn their own stories into interactive text games. And thus, Chronon was born.

### Quick overview
Chronon relies on a concept of pages. A page is a plaintext file with a .chrn extension which contains the story text, along with some scripts to tell the engine what to do when. For example, the player may be shown a certain passage from the page only if the player character passes a skillcheck, or if they have a certain item in their possession, and so on. Since these pages are plaintext files, they can be manually read by the player, which may be undesirable. This is why, the author may choose to hide the content of the pages by starting Chronon from the commandline and using the "cipher" argument. However, this is not foolproof because Chronon is opensource. This is meant more as a deterrent for potential cheaters because it would be more fun to just play the game than to decipher it manually.
