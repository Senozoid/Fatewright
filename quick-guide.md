# A quick guide to Fatewright

## Overview

Fatewright relies on a concept of pages and playthroughs. Pages are units of the storytelling; each player decision or turn of events leads to a new page in the story. And each playthrough is the representation of a single instance of the game; when the game is saved, the playthrough is written to a file in the player's computer.

Pages in Fatewright do not necessarily have just a static text. If the author wants, they can write condition checks. For example, the player may be shown a certain passage from the page only if the player character passes a skillcheck, or if they have a certain item in their possession, and so on. The author can also write commands to dynamically load the value of a variable, such as the player character's name.

At each page, under the story text, the player will be presented with options, a choice through which the next page is determined. This continues until the player character meets their demise, or reaches one of the endings in the story.

No real coding knowledge is required for any of this, but if the author wishes to modify the list of skills available in the game, they simply have to edit a comma separated list inside a java file. Or, if the author is familiar with java, they can control every single detail about the mechanics of the game to have an extremely customised RPG.
