# A quick guide to Fatewright

## Overview

Fatewright relies on a concept of pages and playthroughs. Pages are units of the storytelling; each player decision or turn of events leads to a new page in the story. And each playthrough is the representation of a single instance of the game; when the game is saved, the playthrough is written to a file in the player's computer.

Pages in Fatewright do not necessarily have just a static text. If the author wants, they can write condition checks. For example, the player may be shown a certain passage from the page only if the player character passes a skillcheck, or if they have a certain item in their possession, and so on. The author can also write commands to dynamically load the value of a variable, such as the player character's name. No coding knowledge is required for any of this, just take a look at the [reference](reference.md).

At each page, under the story text, the player will be presented with options, a choice through which the next page is determined. This continues until the player character meets their demise, or reaches one of the endings in the story.
